      "severity": "Critical|Serious|Moderate|Mild"
    }

}
Rules:

hasInteractions must be true if any interaction is found, otherwise false.

If hasInteractions is false, set interactions to an empty array [] and severity to "Mild".

The severity field at the root must reflect the most severe interaction found in the list.

Each interaction object must include: drug1, drug2, description, and severity.

Use the following severity levels only:

Critical – Immediate Action Required

Serious – Use Alternative

Moderate – Monitor Closely

Mild – No Special Action Required
